# Owen Day: A Virtual House Party

The world may be different this year, but it doesn't mean Owen Day has to be! Well, it's a little bit different, and we're all a little more broken, and time may or may not exist any more so let's celebrate in a space that may or may not really exist.

**When: Saturday, 13 February, 4pm PST / 6pm CST**

Welcome to my house! Well, virtual house. Which means we are unbounded by the constraints of reality for just an evening. This house may not make physical sense, but don't worry, as you get more drunk it gets worse.

On the day of the event, you will get a link to a Zoom, but this is not any old Zoom. It is actually a portal to a house that has been separated from the fabric of reality, existing in all places and no time. Here's the idea: imagine you are attending a college house party. Really put yourself in that headspace. The Zoom will be structured like a house, with breakout rooms for each room of the home. So come on in, mingle amongst the rooms, and maybe meet some new people!

The Zoom will start up at 4pm pacific. Come on through, bring a drink or two, and let's have some fun!

Feel free to invite anyone else who you feel should be here as well! This house has enough room for EVERYONE.

## Drink Menu

I didn't plan this! It's BYOB! Drink whatever you want!
