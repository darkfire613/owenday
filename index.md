title: Owen Day

Owen Day is the true holiday of February 14. There is no acknowledgement of the false holiday. For
too long, we have been constrained by a social obligation, foisted upon us all by the marketing
department of Hallmark, to guilt us into buying chocolates, and greeting cards, and expensive dates.
This is not romance. The death of romance is obligation.
